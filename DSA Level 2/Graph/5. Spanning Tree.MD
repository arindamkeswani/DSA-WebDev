Spanning Tree: Graph where all nodes are connected to each other.
allowed undirected edges and weighetd and unweighetd edges

- Min Spanning tree: Directed, weighted. Nodes connected to each other with minimum weight path

    - Prim's: E log E
    No of vertices: n
    No of edges Allowed: n-1

    Cannot blindly remove costly edges as graph might not be left as connected

    1. Make visited array for all vertices
    2. Maintain PriorityQueue of Pair type with {vtx, edge}

    - Connect cities with min cost : Application of Minimum Spanning Tree


- Shortest Path Algo

Single src, minimum path to all other vertices
    - Djikstra's Algo: E log E, +ve, 0 edge weights, directed+undirected
    - Bellman Ford: E.V,-ve,  +ve, 0 edge weights, directed+undirected
    - Floyd, V^3, useful for multi-src


Diff b/w Prim's and Djikstra's 
Prim | Djikstra
Gives MST, which is not necessarily shortest path | Gives Shortest path (from src node to all vertices)
INdividual edge wt is stored | Cumulative wt from stc till vtx is stored
